## Philosophy

These materials are organized so that _relevant_ and _generic_ content is prioritized

principles applied in these slides:

- Cover the most important aspects first, dive deeper later
  - do sensible exercises as early as possible
  - keep details for later or provide references for self-study
- Prioritize general priniples that can be applied elsewhere (e.g. focus on "SQL basics" instead of "SQL in Python")
