# Automated testing

## Automated testing

Programs / functions / classes may be tested automatically to ensure they behave as expected

## Tools for testing JavaScript

- _node_ is needed to provide a runtime
- _assert_: basic assertion package, built into node
- _Jest_: test runner & assertion library
- _Jasmine_: test runner & assertion library
- _Mocha_: test runner
- _Chai_: assertion library

## Example: shorten

We are going to write and test a function that will shorten a string to a specified length:

```js
shorten('loremipsum', 6);
// should return 'lor...'
```

Possible approaches:

- write implementation first
- write tests first (test-driven development)

## setting up the test runner

in an existing npm project:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest
```

in _package.json_:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest"
}
```

## Running tests

```bash
npm test
```

Note: running tests should always be cancelled bevor running `npm install ...` - otherwise the Installation may fail

## Finding tests

In general testing libraries look for files ending in `.test.js` or `.spec.js` inside the `test` directory.

We can also pass a custom pattern, e.g.:

```bash
mocha "src/**/*.{test,spec}.{js,jsx}"
```

## Test coverage

Some testing libraries can report on how much of the code is covered by tests:

example: in a create-react-app project:

```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```

## Example: shorten

```js
// shorten.js
const shorten = (s, maxlength) => {
  if (s.length > maxlength) {
    s = s.slice(0, maxlength - 3) + '...';
  }
  return s;
};

export default shorten;
```

## Example: shorten

```js
// shorten.test.js
import shorten from './shorten.js';
// use node's built-in assert module
import assert from 'assert';

it('shortens "loremipsum" to "lor..."', () => {
  const expected = 'lor...';
  const actual = shorten('loremipsum', 6);
  assert.equal(actual, expected);
});
```
