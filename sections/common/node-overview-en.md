# Node.js and npm

## Node.js and npm

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime

It may be used to:

- run scripts locally
- provide development tools (e.g. for build process, unit tests, ...)
- run a backend

## Node.js and npm

_npm_ is short for _Node package manager_; it is used to access the npm package registry which provides a huge collection of libraries to download

npm comes bundled with node.js; another alternative would be _yarn_

## Node.js installation

Node can be downloaded from https://nodejs.org

Major releases are made available every 6 months. Major releases with even version numbers (e.g. 10) are long-term-support releases.
