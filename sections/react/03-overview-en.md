# React.js

## What is React?

- One of the 3 big JavaScript UI libraries (besides Angular, vue.js)

## Basics of modern JavaScript UI libraries

- declarative
- component-based

## declarative

- In the background there is a data model which describes the entire application state
- The data model changes in response to user interactions, causing the view to update automatically (and efficiently)

## component-based

- "custom" HTML-Tags
- data flow via props and events
- usually unidirectional dataflow (from parent to child)

## Example: data model and data flow in a Todo app

<img src="assets/todo-components-datamodel.svg" type="text/svg" style="width: 300px">

## What makes React special?

- JavaScript-based template syntax
- explicit state changes via setters
- immutable state objects

## History of React

- open-sourced by Facebook in 2013
