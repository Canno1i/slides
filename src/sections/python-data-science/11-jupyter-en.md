# Jupyter & IPython

## IPython

IPython = advanced interactive Python console, supports features like autocompletion

## Jupyter notebooks

Jupyter notebook = interactive graphical Python environment, includes IPython functionalities

Jupyter is browser-based; the backend can be run on the local machine or can be hosted on a server

## Jupyter notebooks - online

Try Jupyter online:

### Google Colab (Google account needed)

- Go to https://colab.research.google.com
- Select _File_ - _New Python 3 Notebook_

### Binder (limited sessions)

- Go to https://jupyter.org/try
- Select _Try Jupyter with Python_
- wait ...
- Select _File_ - _New Notebook_ - _Python 3_

## Jupyter notebooks - locally

Launching Jupyter: Entry _Jupyter Notebook_ in the start menu

Stopping Jupyter: Press _Quit_ in the top right corner of the directory tree view (usually under http://localhost:8888/tree)

## Notebook files

Jupyter notebook files can be created via _new_ - _Notebook: Python 3_

Will be saved under _notebook.ipynb_

_Ipynb_: File format that can contain Python code, outputs, text documentation

## Writing and evaluating code

Write code into a cell, e.g.

```py
import time
time.sleep(3)
"hello"
```

and press _Shift_ + _Enter_

## Writing and evaluating code

IPython has numbered inputs, e.g. `In [1]`

When a computation is ongoing it will display `In [*]`

If the last statement in a cell evaluates to something it will be considered the output and displayed

In order to restart the notebook and re-evaluate all cells, press ‚è©

## Accessing the last output

```py
print(_ * 3)
```

## Writing documentation via markdown

We can add documentation via the standardized _markdown_ language:

Change the dropdown from _Code_ to _Markdown_ and try the following code:

```md
# Heading

- item 1
- item 2
```

Run the cell to display the result, double click to edit again

## Documentation

displaying documentation in any Python console:

```py
help(str)
```

(navigate through long outputs via _Enter_, exit via _Q_)

shortcut for IPython / Jupyter:

```ipython
str?
```

## Tab completion and wildcard expressions

```ipython
*Error?
```

## Running terminal commands

IPython includes direct access to many terminal commands, e.g. `ls`, `cd`, ...

We can execute any terminal command by prefixing it with `!`
