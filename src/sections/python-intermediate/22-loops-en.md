# Loops

## Loops

Exercise: Multiplication table

## Continue & break

The keywords `continue` and `break` may be used to end the current iteration or the entire loop respectively.

In nested loops they refer to the innermost loop.

## for ... else

A for loop can have an optional else clause

It will be executed if the loop finishes normally - i.e. if Python does not encounter a `break` or `return` statement

## for ... else

This functionality is not present in any other widespread language

Many Python developers don't know it either

Quote from Python's inventor:

> I would not have the feature at all if I had to do it over.

## Exercises

- `is_prime()` with loops and `for ... else`
