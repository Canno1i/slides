# State management

## State management

In more complex fontend-applications it makes sense to manage the state (model) separately from the view.

Often the entire application state is represented by a data model and every change to the state will be done by triggering a change to the data model.

## State management tools

- reducer hook (included in React, conceptually similar to Redux)
- Redux (commonly used with React)
- MobX (commonly used with React)
- ngrx (used with Angular)
- vuex (used with vue)
