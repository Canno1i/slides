# Combining comparisons

## Combining comparisons

- combining with the three keywords: `and`, `or`, `not`
- chaining comparisons

## Combining with and, or, not

Examples:

```py
if age >= 18 and country == "de":
    print("may drink alcohol")

if temperature < -10 or temperature > 30:
    print("extreme weather")

if not value > 10:
    print("value not greater than 10")
```

## Chaining comparisons

`a` and `b` are both `0`

```py
a == b == 0
```

`b` lies between 4 and 10

```py
4 < b < 10
```
