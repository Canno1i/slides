# Counting loops

## Counting loops

This is how we can count from 0 to 9 in Python:

```py
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
```

The function call `range(n)` returns the first `n` natural numbers (starting at 0)

## Counting loops

exercise: creating a "multiplication table"

```txt
1 x 7 = 7
2 x 7 = 14
3 x 7 = 21
4 x 7 = 28
...
```
