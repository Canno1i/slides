# React.js

## What is React?

- One of the 3 big JavaScript-UI-Libraries (besides Angular, vue.js)

## Basics of modern JavaScript-UI-Libraries

- declarative
- component-based

## declarative

- In the Background there is a data model which describes the entire application state
- The data model changes in response to user interactions, causing the view to update automatically (and efficiently)

## component-based

- "custom" HTML-Tags
- data-flow via props and events
- usually unidirectional dataflow (from parent to child)

## What makes React special?

- JavaScript-based template-syntax
- explicit Mutations of state via _setState()_

## History of React

- used internally at Facebook from 2011
- open source since 2013
- current major version: React 16 (September 2017)
